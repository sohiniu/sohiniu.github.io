I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Harvard University where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Krzysztof Gajos](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~kgajos/).

I am broadly interested in understanding how automated decision-making creates, perpetuates, and amplifies harm. My current research spans HCI, technology policy, and AI interpretability. My publications are listed [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=XQCyotoAAAAJ).

After a wonderful summer interning with the [Technology for Liberty Project at the ACLU of Massachusetts](https://www.aclum.org/en/issues/privacy-and-surveillance), I am excited to be spending Fall 2022 interning at the [Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (S.T.O.P)](https://www.stopspying.org). Before my Ph.D., I worked as a Research Engineer at IBM Research AI and received Bachelor of Arts degrees in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Chicago.

My pronouns are she/her.
