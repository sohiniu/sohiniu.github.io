I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Harvard University where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Krzysztof Gajos](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~kgajos/). My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of HCI and technology policy. 

Most human-AI interaction research focuses on supporting the needs of decision-makers. My research is concerned with supporting the needs of decision-subjects â€” individuals subject to high-stakes or adverse AI decisions. Currently, I am interested in understanding how to support decision-subjects in contesting AI systems and decisions. My publications are listed [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=XQCyotoAAAAJ).

Thus far in my Ph.D., I have been privileged to have interned with the [Technology for Liberty Project at the ACLU of Massachusetts](https://www.aclum.org/en/issues/privacy-and-surveillance) and the [Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (S.T.O.P)](https://www.stopspying.org). Before my Ph.D., I worked as a Research Engineer at IBM Research AI and received Bachelor of Arts degrees in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Chicago.
