I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Harvard University where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Krzysztof Gajos.

I am broadly interested in understanding how automated decision-making creates, perpetuates, and amplifies harm. My current research spans HCI, technology policy, and AI interpretability.

I am excited to be spending Summer 2022 interning with the Technology for Liberty Project at the ACLU of Massachusetts! Before my Ph.D., I worked as a Research Engineer at IBM Research AI and received Bachelor of Arts degrees in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Chicago.
