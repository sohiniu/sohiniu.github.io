I am a Computer Computer Science PhD candidate at Harvard University where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Krzysztof Gajos. 

I am broadly interested in understanding the ways in which automated decision making creates, perpetuates, and amplifies harm. My current research spans HCI, technology policy, and AI interpretability. 

I am excited to be spending Summer 2022 interning with the Techology for Liberty Project at the ACLU of Massachusetts! Prior to my PhD, I worked as a Research Engineer at IBM Research AI and received Bachelor of Arts degrees in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Chicago.
